#  Pacman Game in C++ (Console-based)

Welcome to my console-based **Pacman game**, developed in **C++** as part of a first-semester learning project. This version includes four types of ghosts, a scoring system, power-up mechanics, and full maze rendering using `windows.h`.

A colorful Pacman remake with smart ghost behaviors, power pills, and custom maze loading — blending classic gameplay with beginner-friendly C++ logic.
